Supervised Machine Learning - Loan Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Supervized learning is machine learning algorithm which makes estimates and predictions by learning and emulating data that was fed to the system in the form of training data.

Credit worthiness of an individual can be based on different factors like income, currently outstanding debt amount, debt to income ratio, previously derogatory remarks, etc. 
Overall, all these different variables and chances of a person defaulting on their payments.

In this, program we attempt to create a supervized learning where we use different variables to estimate credit worthiness. We also explore confusion matrix and classification metrics to check the efficiency of the model that we made.

The program also samples different numbers of classes in attempt to remove biases.

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
